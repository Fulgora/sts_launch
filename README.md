# KSP|kOS-Script for my STS Shuttle series
This should / might work with other shuttle systems as well... I am not liable for any explosions that might result from the usage of this script though.
<br />
;-)
<br />
<br />
###### Note: Currently the script is set to a 25Â° inclination (for STS 3 mission)
<br />
<br />
KSP-Mod required (you can also install it via CKAN):<br />
https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS<br />
<br />
(written for kOS v 1.0.3)
<br />
<br />
File location (just the file 'sts_launch', not the .zip version of the repo!):<br />
Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script

## Usage:
Open the script with any text-editor of your choice (I recommend notepad++ or atom)
Adjust any parameters in the script you like to change (apoapsis, inclinations...)

Then open the terminal: Click on the kOS mod icon and then click the computer icon in the window that pops up.
I am using kOS for All mod in the video and click on the MK-3 Crew cabin -> Open Terminal

#### Launch the shuttle:
Type in the terminal:
<br />
<br />
switch to 0.<br />
run sts_launch.<br />
<br />
This runs the script on your ship while it is stored on the 'harddrive' in the KSC
<br />

#### Tested with:
